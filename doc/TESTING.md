# Release verification

## Native tests

No Pico SDK is needed for these tests. With a C11 compiler and CMake:

```sh
cmake -S firmware/pico2w_c/tests -B build/host-tests -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build/host-tests --config Debug
ctest --test-dir build/host-tests -C Debug --output-on-failure
```

GitHub CI runs this suite on Windows and Linux.

The four suites cover:
- Alarm validity, scheduling, simultaneous slots and duplicate suppression.
- Calendar conversion, leap days, Europe/Berlin transitions, NTP era rollover, invalid headers and mismatched request nonces.
- MAC parsing, unique combined catalogs and preservation of useful saved names.
- Settings v1-v7 decoding and migration to v8, Wi-Fi fields, extended alarm tracks, A/B fallback after corruption, failed writes and refusal to erase unknown sectors. Flash is simulated, so this is not a physical Flash endurance test.

## Firmware builds

Default build:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\build-clock-bt.ps1 -Mp3
```

Bluetooth-only fallback:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\build-clock-bt.ps1 -Mp3 -NoWifi
```

The script supports -BuildDirectory for an ASCII build path and -HelixPath for an existing external decoder checkout. It records the Git revision and marks tracked uncommitted changes as dirty. Release builds must have a clean source revision.

## Device acceptance before stable release

Follow [network acceptance](NETWORK_TIME.md#hardware-acceptance) and [firmware verification](../firmware/pico2w_c/README.md#on-device-verification). In addition:
- Start discovery, select no new device and exit; the preferred connection must resume.
- Find a saved speaker again; it must appear once and keep its useful name even if discovery reports Unknown.
- Test a music alarm above track 45 with a real matching file.
- Check version after updating and retain the UF2 build-ID sidecar.
- Run the assembled clock overnight with the actual access point, Portable/Nest, RTC, SD and DFPlayer.

Earlier hardware passes are retained in [HARDWARE_TEST_EVIDENCE.md](HARDWARE_TEST_EVIDENCE.md); they do not imply that newly added features have passed device testing.
